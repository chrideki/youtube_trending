# Visualization with Python, Project 1

This the my first project in Data Analyst Training Accelerator class at Galvanize New York.   

The goal of this exercise is to analyze a dataset using Python and its visualization tools, in order to obtain exploratory graphs and insights.

In this project I'm going to analyze a dataset which includes data about trending video on YouTube. Here's the data source: https://www.kaggle.com/hoonkeng/deep-analysis-on-youtube-trending-videos-eda/notebook

In the dataset, collected across 10 countries, we find information about views, video descriptions, title, category, tag, number of like, dislikes, comments.   
Two versions of the dataset are available: in the first one there is one global collection; in the second we have more collection from 2017 to 2018. 

My analysis will have two parts:
1. an overview of the data, with some general observations
2. focus on some relevant aspect for the YouTube user
